# OIF Solver Plugin Architecture Proposal

## Executive Summary

The OIF Solver adopts a **plugin-based architecture** that transforms the traditional monolithic solver design into a modular, extensible toolkit. This architecture enables third parties to leverage individual components or deploy the complete solution, promoting reusability and customization while maintaining system coherence.

## Module Deep Dive

### Core Engine

**Responsibility**: Orchestrates the complete solver workflow from intent discovery to settlement completion.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Event as Event Bus
    participant Core as Core Engine
    participant State as State Manager
    participant Plugin as Plugin Factory

    Event->>Core: Intent Event
    Core->>Plugin: Get Required Plugins
    Plugin-->>Core: Plugin Instances

    Core->>State: Update Intent Status
    Core->>Core: Execute Workflow

    alt Success
        Core->>Event: Workflow Complete
    else Error
        Core->>State: Mark Failed
        Core->>Event: Error Event
    end
```

### Discovery Service

**Responsibility**: Monitors multiple sources for new intents and validates them before processing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source as Intent Source
    participant Plugin as Discovery Plugin
    participant Service as Discovery Service
    participant Core as Core Engine

    Source->>Plugin: New Intent
    Plugin->>Plugin: Parse & Validate
    Plugin->>Service: Valid Intent

    Service->>Service: Enrich Metadata
    Service->>Core: Intent Ready

    Note over Service: Health Monitoring
    Service->>Plugin: Health Check
    Plugin-->>Service: Status
```

### Delivery Service

**Responsibility**: Handles transaction lifecycle from preparation to confirmation across multiple blockchains.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Core as Core Engine
    participant Service as Delivery Service
    participant Plugin as Chain Plugin
    participant Chain as Blockchain

    Core->>Service: Submit Transaction
    Service->>Plugin: Prepare Transaction
    Plugin->>Plugin: Estimate Gas & Nonce
    Plugin->>Chain: Submit

    Chain-->>Plugin: Transaction Hash
    Plugin->>Service: Monitor Transaction

    loop Confirmation Check
        Plugin->>Chain: Check Status
        Chain-->>Plugin: Status Update
    end

    Plugin->>Service: Transaction Confirmed
    Service->>Core: Delivery Complete
```

### Settlement Service

**Responsibility**: Verifies settlement conditions and orchestrates claim processing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Core as Core Engine
    participant Service as Settlement Service
    participant Oracle as Oracle Plugin
    participant Delivery as Delivery Service

    Core->>Service: Process Fill Event
    Service->>Oracle: Check Attestation
    Oracle-->>Service: Attestation Ready

    Service->>Service: Generate Claim
    Service->>Delivery: Submit Claim Transaction
    Delivery-->>Service: Claim Submitted

    Service->>Core: Settlement Processing
```

### State Service

**Responsibility**: Provides persistent storage abstraction with automatic TTL management.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Service as State Service
    participant Plugin as Storage Plugin

    App->>Service: Store Data with TTL
    Service->>Service: Validate TTL
    Service->>Plugin: Store Data
    Plugin-->>Service: Success

    Service->>Service: Schedule Expiry

    Note over Service: TTL Management
    Service->>Plugin: Delete Expired
    Plugin-->>Service: Deleted
```

## Benefits

### Modularity

- Each component has clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Independent testing and development of individual services
- Simplified debugging through isolated components

### Extensibility

- New protocols supported by adding plugins without core changes
- Third parties can implement custom plugins for specific needs
- Gradual migration and protocol upgrades through plugin versioning

### Reusability

- Components can be used independently in other projects
- Discovery service useful for any blockchain monitoring needs
- Delivery service applicable to any transaction submission system

### Flexibility

- Mix and match plugins based on deployment requirements
- Deploy minimal configurations for specific use cases
- Scale individual services independently based on load

## Drawbacks & Mitigations

### Complexity

- **Issue**: Plugin interfaces add abstraction layers
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and developer tooling

### Performance Overhead

- **Issue**: Dynamic dispatch and trait object costs
- **Mitigation**: Use static dispatch where possible, profile critical paths

### Configuration Management

- **Issue**: Complex configuration with many plugin options
- **Mitigation**: Sensible defaults, configuration templates, and validation

## Conclusion

The plugin-based architecture transforms the OIF Solver into a flexible, reusable toolkit that balances modularity with performance. This design enables developers to integrate specific components, operators to deploy customized configurations, and the broader ecosystem to evolve through community-contributed plugins.
